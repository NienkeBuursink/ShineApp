		<section><!--reviews-->
			<h2>1 in 3 reviews refer to Shine as life-changing</h2>
			<ul>
				<p>
					All the mental health tools I was searching for put together into one amazing app. 
					It's a gratitude journal, inspirational podcast library, meditation library, daily affirmation subscription, 
					and community of mental health positive people. Please give this a try!
				</p>
				<p>
					I have purchased reflection journals and listened to other apps but this one is different.
					This app is perfect because in their voices is my voice, my experiences. Every episode so far 
					has resonated deeply with me as a Latina who often suffers from imposter syndrome.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is so worth it! So inclusive and specific!! The amount of support and help is amazing.
					Great community. I can't afford therapy and this has helped me more than any therapist. 
					I loved it so much I bought my twin sister and bestie a membership.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you have stress or anxiety, a lack of confidence or self esteem, or just want to relax your mind,
					this app is for you. Their SHINE method for Anxiety is amazing, and doing the Daily Shine every morning 
					makes my days start off so much better. Paying for all the meditations is well worth it.
				</p>
				<p>
					I was never really taught anything about self-care or self-healing nor healthy coping skills. 
					This app has really helped open that door for me. I'm a single mother of 5 so life can really be challenging at times, 
					Shine helps ground me and remind me I'm in control.
